The difference to an auto-merge on submit is that auto-merge on submit is in some way implicit and changes created in the UI are subject to review.\n\nI thought the same actually when drafting this fix on the ECA plugin: the Gerrit server should perform the operation *on behalf* of the user clicking the button on the UI, exactly as the rebase button.\n\nI could be implemented in Gerrit core on master, which is fine as long as you guys can find a workaround in the meantime ðŸ˜Š\n\nIt could just be asking the Eclipse Foundation to allow GerritHub as committer on their backend.",
